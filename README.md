hii marc, diba I told you na by the end of march I'll explain how'd I catch feelings for you?
 
             So ano kasi, I realized kasi na my feelings for you doesn't fade tho nag karo'n ako ng ka rs. I don't even know na di pala nawala feelings ko for you but I does have feelings for someone too, ang red flag lng pakinggan hehe but I'm telling the truth so nasasayo if maniniwala ka.

             Nung second day na napunta ako sa section n'yo non is dun ako napunta malapit sayo diba? it's not obvious pero I'm looking at you the whole time na nandon ako using mga peripheral eyesight, and dun ko na realize na I'm not already have moveon kasi everytime na tumitingin ako sayo is naf-feel ko na nandun padin yung feelings ko, like parang di s'ya nawala and pabalikbalik s'ya anytime na makikita kita, 

             Just like what I've said, hindi kita kinakausap just b'cos I had feelings for you.Kinakausap kita kasi I really want to bring our closure back, yung times na we're really close to each other, we treating each other like BEST FRIENDS and I wanna bring the times that we're laughing at each other, copying each others answers, making a competition on recitation during AP. I just missed that, and I have someday we're that close to each other again.

             I like you, I like who you are, what you are I love your presence, your personality, appearance, I love how we're have lots in common. I'm glad to  have you as part of my life, thankyou for existing, thankyou for being who you really are around me, thankyou for all those advices you give, thankyou for being a kind person to me, thankyou kasi when I was talking to you, I feel safe and I know my worth, and lastly, thankyou kasi I can be what I am around you, that I don't have to fake my personality, and thankyou kasi when I'm talking to you I'm comfortable and no worries about how's life.

               I love how you makes my day, how you makes me happy, makes me feel worthy, makes me feel not unwanted, I love how you showed me how a friendship really is, tho it takes a few months before we talked again but your treatment never change, you really know how to make me smile.It's okay if you don't really care about my messages, and I'm sorry if sometimes I'm annoying, I'm sorry if I'm not that entertaining, I hope you'll understand:> 

               thankyou for your time  reading this short  message tho for me it's not enough to  express my feelings cuz I really don't know how to explain what I feel. All of this are true including that ''I like you". Have a nice day/night, ^ Ã— ^
